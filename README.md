# 10.1

Implemented Jest to verify that your objects were created properly.

Learned the TDD cycle: Red (fail), Green (pass), Refactor.

Wrote a constructor function to generate new objects.

# 10.2

You implemented mocking to keep player tests independent.

You wrote tests that check for the correct usage of various object methods.

You added methods to your Player() constructor using the prototype syntax.

# 10.3

Write Jest tests that fake data updates to check multiple conditions

Use built-in Array prototype methods

# 10.4

Use the Inquirer package to control the flow of a game or app.

Use object-oriented programming (OOP) to keep all game logic contained in a single object.

# 10.4

Use method inheritance to cut down on code duplication

Convert constructor functions to ES6 classes to make inheritance even easier
